		<h1>What is RetroArch?</h1>
		<p>	RetroArch is a modular multi-system game/emulator system that is designed to be fast,
			lightweight, and portable. It has features few other dedicated games / emulators have,
			such as: <br />
			<ul>
				<li>Real-time rewinding</li>
				<li>Multi-pass shaders (up to 8-pass)</li>
				<li>Game aware shading</li>
				<li>Remote networked sound support</li>
				<li>A built-in GUI/OSD system</li>
			</ul>
				And more...
			</p>
		
		<h1>What platforms does it support?</h1>
		<p>	RetroArch sets the standard on cross-platform portability right now.</p>
		<ul>	<li>Linux (x86 and x86_64)</li>
			<li>Windows (32bit/64bit)</li>
			<li>Mac OSX (PPC/Intel)</li>
			<li>Playstation 3 (PS3 SDK/PSL1GHT (WIP))</li>
			<li>Xbox 1 (XDK)</li>
			<li>Xbox 360 (XeXDK/Libxenon)</li>
			<li>Gamecube</li>
			<li>Wii</li>
			<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
			<li>OpenPandora</li>
			<li>Android</li>
			<li>Blackberry (10/Playbook)</li>
			<li>iOS</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Why is RetroArch special?</h1>
		<p>	Right now RetroArch is unique in that it runs the same emulator cores on multiple systems
			(such as Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, PC, etc).</p>
		<p>	For each emulator 'core', RetroArch makes use of a library API that we like to
			call 'libretro'.</p>
		<p>Think of libretro as an interface for emulator and game ports. You can make a libretro port once and expect the same code to run on all the platforms that RetroArch supports. It's designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind so that the porter can worry about the port at hand instead of having to wrestle with an obfuscatory API.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the project is to help ease the work of the emulator/game porter by giving him an API that allows him to target multiple platforms at once without having to redo any code. He doesn't have to worry about writing input/video/audio drivers - all of that is supplied to him by RetroArch. All he has to do is to have the emulator port hook into the libretro API and that's it - we take care of the rest.</p>

      <h1>What is libretro?</h1>
      <p>Libretro is an API designed for simple abstraction of the functions inherent in retro-style, 2D games. Any project that conforms to the API can then be hooked into any libretro frontend for execution. RetroArch is currently the most common and well-known frontend, and it is available on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Android, Wii, Xbox 1, Xbox 360, PS3, and more. Other platform-specific frontends are currently in development, including native integration with the popular HTPC platform XBMC.</p>
      <h1>Who Uses Libretro?</h1>
      <p>While the most common use case for libretro has been console emulation, it is equally suited as a platform for almost any 2D game. For example, the NX Engine used in the popular freeware game Cave Story has been successfully ported to libretro, open sourced games like Quake and Doom have been ported to libretro, and the new freeware game Dinothawr supports libretro natively.</p>
      <h1>Why Should Developers Target Libretro?</h1>
      <p>Software that targets the libretro API instantly gains access to all of the platforms that have libretro frontends available. That means your game is immediately available to those platforms’ users without worrying about input/audio/video drivers, compatibility issues or the myriad quirks of the underlying host system(s). Likewise, there’s no need to write specialized GUI code for each platform or to use esoteric–and often buggy–cross-platform toolkits, like Qt and GTK+.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, once your game supports libretro, all of the libretro frontends’ other features come along for free, such as RetroArch’s real-time rewind, lag-concealing netplay, lossless video recording/streaming and cutting-edge post-processing shader support.</p>
      <p>Perhaps best of all: libretro is an open specification that is 100% free to implement, with no licensing fees or hidden strings attached.</p>
